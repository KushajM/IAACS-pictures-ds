Hello!
Please clone the git repo and use npm start to run the nodejs and express code and wait a few seconds before the images load in. They are saved in the images/ folder. 
The info.py file outputs a csv file with the scores of the downloaded images and renames the downloaded images as 1.jpg till 50.jpg. To run this use python info.py in the console.
